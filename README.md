# Digital-Password-Lock-with-Mini-Game

The “Digital Password Lock with Additional Feature – Mini Game” is a combination of digital password lock and mini game. 

The digital password lock will prompt user to set their own password for the lock and will show password was successfully set. If the user enters the correct password set, a message which stated correct password will be shown on LCD. However, if the user key in the wrong password, incorrect password message will be shown. A key on the keypad can be pressed to turn the digital password lock into mini game system. 

The game “Tic-Tac-Toe” was designed for this project. Tic-Tac-Toe is a game in which two players seek in alternate turns to complete a row, a column, or a diagonal with either three O's or three X's drawn in the spaces of a grid of nine squares. In this project, Red LEDs represent player 1, while Blue LEDs represent player 2. If either three LEDs in same color lights up in a row, column or diagonal, the player that represented by the color wins.
